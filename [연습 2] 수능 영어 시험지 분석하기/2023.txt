To whom it may concern,

My name is Michael Brown. I have been a bird-watcher since 
childhood. I have always enjoyed watching birds in my yard 
and identifying them by sight and sound. Yesterday, I happened 
to read an article about your club. I was surprised and excited 
to find out about a community of passionate bird-watchers who 
travel annually to go birding. I would love to join your club, 
but your website appears to be under construction. I could not 
find any information except for this contact email address. I 
would like to know how to sign up for the club. I look forward 
to your reply.

Sincerely,
Michael Brown

19. 다음 글에 드러난 Jamie의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?

Putting all of her energy into her last steps of the running 
race, Jamie crossed the finish line. To her disappointment, she 
had failed to beat her personal best time, again. Jamie had 
pushed herself for months to finally break her record, but it 
was all for nothing. Recognizing how she felt about her 
failure, Ken, her teammate, approached her and said, “Jamie, 
even though you didn’t set a personal best time today, your 
performances have improved dramatically. Your running skills 
have progressed so much! You’ll definitely break your personal 
best time in the next race!” After hearing his comments, she 
felt confident about herself. Jamie, now motivated to keep 
pushing for her goal, replied with a smile. “You’re right! Next 
race, I’ll beat my best time for sure!”

① indifferent → regretful
② pleased → bored
③ frustrated → encouraged ④ nervous → fearful
⑤ calm

→ excited

20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?

At every step in our journey through life we encounter 
junctions with many different pathways leading into the 
distance. Each choice involves uncertainty about which path will 
get you to your destination. Trusting our intuition to make the 
choice often ends up with us making a suboptimal choice. 
Turning the uncertainty into numbers has proved a potent way of 
analyzing the paths and finding the shortcut to your destination. 
The mathematical theory of probability hasn’t eliminated risk, 
but it allows us to manage that risk more effectively. The strategy 
is to analyze all the possible scenarios that the future holds and 
then to see what proportion of them lead to success or failure. 
This gives you a much better map of the future on which to base 
your decisions about which path to choose.

* junction: 분기점 ** suboptimal: 차선의
① 더 나은 선택을 위해 성공 가능성을 확률적으로 분석해야 한다.
② 중요한 결정을 내릴 때에는 자신의 직관에 따라 판단해야 한다.
③ 성공적인 삶을 위해 미래에 대한 구체적인 계획을 세워야 한다.
④ 빠른 목표 달성을 위해 지름길로 가고자 할 때 신중해야 한다. 
⑤ 인생의 여정에서 선택에 따른 결과를 스스로 책임져야 한다.

21. 밑줄 친 make oneself public to oneself 가 다음 글에서 의미

23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점]

하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점]

Coming of age in the 18th and 19th centuries, the personal 
diary became a centerpiece in the construction of a modern 
subjectivity, at the heart of which is the application of reason 
and critique to the understanding of world and self, which 
allowed the creation of a new kind of knowledge. Diaries were 
central media through which enlightened and free subjects 
could be constructed. They provided a space where one could 
write daily about her whereabouts, feelings, and thoughts. 
Over time and with rereading, disparate entries, events, and 
happenstances could be rendered into insights and narratives 
about the self, and allowed for the formation of subjectivity. It 
is in that context that the idea of “the self [as] both made and 
explored with words” emerges. Diaries were personal and 
private; one would write for oneself, or, in Habermas’s 
formulation, one would make oneself public to oneself. By 
making the self public in a private sphere, the self also became 
an object for self-inspection and self-critique.

* disparate: 이질적인 ** render: 만들다

① use writing as a means of reflecting on oneself
② build one’s identity by reading others’ diaries
③ exchange feedback in the process of writing
④ create an alternate ego to present to others
⑤ develop topics for writing about selfhood

An important advantage of disclosure, as opposed to more 
aggressive forms of regulation, is its flexibility and respect for 
the operation of free markets. Regulatory mandates are blunt 
swords; they tend to neglect diversity and may have serious 
unintended adverse effects. For example, energy efficiency 
requirements for appliances may produce goods that work less 
well or that have characteristics that consumers do not want. 
Information provision, by contrast, respects freedom of 
choice. If automobile manufacturers are required to measure 
and publicize the safety characteristics of cars, potential car 
purchasers can trade safety concerns against other attributes, 
such as price and styling. If restaurant customers are informed 
of the calories in their meals, those who want to lose weight 
can make use of the information, leaving those who are 
unconcerned about calories unaffected. Disclosure does not 
interfere with, and should even promote, the autonomy (and 
quality) of individual decision-making.

* mandate: 명령 ** adverse: 거스르는 *** autonomy: 자율성

① effects of diversified markets on reasonable customer choices
② necessities of identifying and analyzing current industry trends
③ strategies for companies to increase profits in a free market
④ benefits of publicizing information to ensure free choices
⑤ steps to make public information accessible to customers 

22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?

24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?

Urban delivery vehicles can be adapted to better suit the 
density of urban distribution, which often involves smaller 
vehicles such as vans, including bicycles. The latter have the 
potential to become a preferred ‘last-mile’ vehicle, particularly 
in high-density and congested areas. In locations where 
bicycle use is high, such as the Netherlands, delivery bicycles 
are also used to carry personal cargo (e.g. groceries). Due to 
their low acquisition and maintenance costs, cargo bicycles 
convey much potential in developed and developing countries 
alike, such as the becak (a three-wheeled bicycle) in Indonesia. 
Services using electrically assisted delivery tricycles have 
been successfully implemented in France and are gradually 
being adopted across Europe for services as varied as parcel 
and catering deliveries. Using bicycles as cargo vehicles is 
particularly encouraged when combined with policies that 
restrict motor vehicle access to specific areas of a city, such as 
downtown or commercial districts, or with the extension of 
dedicated bike lanes.

Different parts of the brain’s visual system get information 
on a need-to-know basis. Cells that help your hand muscles 
reach out to an object need to know the size and location of 
the object, but they don’t need to know about color. They need 
to know a little about shape, but not in great detail. Cells that 
help you recognize people’s faces need to be extremely 
sensitive to details of shape, but they can pay less attention to 
location. It is natural to assume that anyone who sees an object 
sees everything about it ― the shape, color, location, and 
movement. However, one part of your brain sees its shape, 
another sees color, another detects location, and another 
perceives movement. Consequently, after localized brain 
damage, it is possible to see certain aspects of an object and 
not others. Centuries ago, people found it difficult to imagine 
how someone could see an object without seeing what color it 
is. Even today, you might find it surprising to learn about 
people who see an object without seeing where it is, or see it 
without seeing whether it is moving.

것은?

Niklas Luhmann, a renowned sociologist of the twentieth 
century, was born in Lüneburg, Germany in 1927. After World 
War II, he studied law at the University of Freiburg until 1949. 
Early in his career, he worked for the State of Lower Saxony, 
where he was in charge of educational reform. In 1960—1961, 
Luhmann had the chance to study sociology at Harvard 
University, where he was influenced by Talcott Parsons, one 
of the most famous social system theorists. Later, Luhmann 
developed his own social system theory. In 1968, he became a 
professor of sociology at the University of Bielefeld. He 
researched a variety of subjects, including mass media and 
law. Although his books are known to be difficult to translate, 
they have in fact been widely translated into other languages.

[31～34] 다음 빈칸에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오.

Trends constantly suggest new opportunities for individuals 
to restage themselves, representing occasions for change. To 
understand how trends can ultimately give individuals power 
and freedom, one must first discuss fashion’s importance as a 
basis for change. The most common explanation offered by 
my informants as to why fashion is so appealing is ① that it 
constitutes a kind of theatrical costumery. Clothes are part of 
how people present ② them to the world, and fashion locates 
them in the present, relative to what is happening in society 
and to fashion’s own history. As a form of expression, fashion 
contains a host of ambiguities, enabling individuals to recreate 
the meanings ③ associated with specific pieces of clothing. 
Fashion is among the simplest and cheapest methods of 
self-expression: clothes can be ④ inexpensively purchased 
while making it easy to convey notions of wealth, intellectual 
stature, relaxation or environmental consciousness, even if 
none of these is true. Fashion can also strengthen agency in 
various ways, ⑤ opening up space for action.

31. There is something deeply paradoxical about the professional 
status of sports journalism, especially in the medium of print. 
In discharging their usual responsibilities of description and 
commentary, reporters’ accounts of sports events are eagerly 
consulted by sports fans, while in their broader journalistic 
role of covering sport in its many forms, sports journalists are 
among the most visible of all contemporary writers. The 
ruminations of the elite class of ‘celebrity’ sports journalists 
are much sought after by the major newspapers, their lucrative 
contracts being the envy of colleagues in other ‘disciplines’ of 
journalism. Yet sports journalists do not have a standing in 
their profession that corresponds to the size of their readerships 
or of their pay packets, with the old saying (now reaching the 
status of cliché) that sport is the ‘toy department of the news 
media’ still readily to hand as a dismissal of the worth of what 
sports journalists do. This reluctance to take sports journalism 
seriously produces the paradoxical outcome that sports 
newspaper writers are much read but little

Everywhere we turn we hear about almighty “cyberspace”! 
The hype promises that we will leave our boring lives, put on 
goggles and body suits, and enter some metallic, three-dimensional, 
multimedia otherworld. When the Industrial Revolution arrived 
with its great innovation, the motor, we didn’t leave our world 
to go to some ① remote motorspace! On the contrary, we 
brought the motors into our lives, as automobiles, refrigerators, 
drill presses, and pencil sharpeners. This ② absorption has 
been so complete that we refer to all these tools with names that 
declare their usage, not their “motorness ”. These innovations 
led to a major socioeconomic movement precisely because they 
entered and ③ affected profoundly our everyday lives. People 
have not changed fundamentally in thousands of years. 
Technology changes constantly. It’s the one that must ④ adapt 
to us. That’s exactly what will happen with information technology 
and its devices under human-centric computing. The longer we 
continue to believe that computers will take us to a magical new 
world, the longer we will ⑤ maintain their natural fusion with 
our lives, the hallmark of every major movement that aspires to 
be called a socioeconomic revolution.

* hype: 과대광고 ** hallmark: 특징

32. People have always wanted to be around other people and 
to learn from them. Cities have long been dynamos of social 
possibility, foundries of art, music, and fashion. Slang, or, if you 
prefer, “lexical innovation,” has always started in cities ― an 
outgrowth of all those different people so frequently exposed to 
one another. It spreads outward, in a manner not unlike trans-
missible disease, which itself typically “takes off” in cities. If, as 
the noted linguist Leonard Bloomfield argued, the way a person 
talks is a “composite result of what he has heard before,” then 
language innovation would happen where the most people heard 
and talked to the most other people. Cities drive taste change 
, 
because they 
who not surprisingly are often the creative people cities seem 
to attract. Media, ever more global, ever more far-reaching, 
spread language faster to more people.

* foundry: 주물 공장 ** lexical: 어휘의

① reduce the social mobility of ambitious outsiders
② present ideal research environments to linguists
③ cause cultural conflicts among users of slang
④ offer the greatest exposure to other people
⑤ provide rich source materials for artists

33. The entrance to a honeybee colony, often referred to as 
the dancefloor, is a market place for information about the 
state of the colony and the environment outside the hive. 
Studying interactions on the dancefloor provides us with a 
number of 
individuals 
illustrative examples of how 
changing their own behavior in response to local information 
. For
example, upon returning to their hive honeybees that have 
collected water search out a receiver bee to unload their water 
to within the hive. If this search time is short then the returning 
bee is more likely to perform a waggle dance to recruit others 
to the water source. Conversely, if this search time is long then 
the bee is more likely to give up collecting water. Since 
receiver bees will only accept water if they require it, either for 
themselves or to pass on to other bees and brood, this unloading 
time is correlated with the colony’s overall need of water. Thus 
the individual water forager’s response to unloading time (up or 
down) regulates water collection in response to the colony’s 
need. [3점]

* brood: 애벌레 ** forager: 조달자

① allow the colony to regulate its workforce
② search for water sources by measuring distance
③ decrease the colony’s workload when necessary
④ divide tasks according to their respective talents
⑤ train workers to acquire basic communication patterns

34. We understand that the segregation of our consciousness 
into present, past, and future is both a fiction and an oddly 
self-referential framework; your present was part of your 
mother’s future, and your children’s past will be in part your 
present. Nothing is generally wrong with structuring our 
consciousness of time in this conventional manner, and it often 
works well enough. In the case of climate change, however, 
the sharp division of time into past, present, and future has 
been desperately misleading and has, most importantly, 
hidden from view the extent of the responsibility of those of 
us alive now. The narrowing of our consciousness of time 
smooths the way to divorcing ourselves from responsibility 
for developments in the past and the future with which our lives 
are in fact deeply intertwined. In the climate case, it is not that 
. It is 
that the realities are obscured from view by the partitioning of 
time, and so questions of responsibility toward the past and 
future do not arise naturally. [3점]

* segregation: 분리 ** intertwine: 뒤얽히게 하다
*** obscure: 흐릿하게 하다

① all our efforts prove to be effective and are thus encouraged
② sufficient scientific evidence has been provided to us
③ future concerns are more urgent than present needs
④ our ancestors maintained a different frame of time
⑤ we face the facts but then deny our responsibility

Actors, singers, politicians and countless others recognise 
the power of the human voice as a means of communication 
beyond the simple decoding of the words that are used. Learning 
to control your voice and use it for different purposes is, 
therefore, one of the most important skills to develop as an early 
career teacher. ① The more confidently you give instructions, 
the higher the chance of a positive class response. ② There are 
times when being able to project your voice loudly will be very 
useful when working in school, and knowing that you can cut 
through a noisy classroom, dinner hall or playground is a great 
skill to have. ③ In order to address serious noise issues in 
school, students, parents and teachers should search for a 
solution together. ④ However, I would always advise that you 
use your loudest voice incredibly sparingly and avoid shouting 
as much as possible. ⑤ A quiet, authoritative and measured 
tone has so much more impact than slightly panicked shouting.

A fascinating species of water flea exhibits a kind of 
flexibility that evolutionary biologists call adaptive plasticity.

(A) That’s a clever trick, because producing spines and a 
helmet is costly, in terms of energy, and conserving 
energy is essential for an organism’s ability to survive and 
reproduce. The water flea only expends the energy needed 
to produce spines and a helmet when it needs to.

(B) If the baby water flea is developing into an adult in water 
that includes the chemical signatures of creatures that 
prey on water fleas, it develops a helmet and spines to 
defend itself against predators. If the water around it 
doesn’t include the chemical signatures of predators, the 
water flea doesn’t develop these protective devices.

(C) So it may well be that this plasticity is an adaptation: a 
trait that came to exist in a species because it contributed 
to reproductive fitness. There are many cases, across 
many species, of adaptive plasticity. Plasticity is conducive 
to fitness if there is sufficient variation in the environment.

The most commonly known form of results-based pricing 

is a practice called contingency pricing, used by lawyers.

It may be easier to reach an agreement when settlement 
terms don’t have to be implemented until months in the future.

(A) Therefore, only an outcome in the client’s favor is 
compensated. From the client’s point of view, the pricing 
makes sense in part because most clients in these cases are 
unfamiliar with and possibly intimidated by law firms. 
Their biggest fears are high fees for a case that may take 
years to settle.

(B) By using contingency pricing, clients are ensured that they 
pay no fees until they receive a settlement. In these and 
other instances of contingency pricing, the economic value 
of the service is hard to determine before the service, and 
providers develop a price that allows them to share the 
risks and rewards of delivering value to the buyer.

(C) Contingency pricing is the major way that personal injury 
and certain consumer cases are billed. In this approach, 
lawyers do not receive fees or payment until the case is 
settled, when they are paid a percentage of the money that 
the client receives. [3점]

Negotiators should try to find ways to slice a large issue into 
smaller pieces, known as using salami tactics. ( ① ) Issues 
that can be expressed in quantitative, measurable units are easy 
to slice. ( ② ) For example, compensation demands can be 
divided into cents-per-hour increments or lease rates can be 
quoted as dollars per square foot. ( ③ ) When working to 
fractionate issues of principle or precedent, parties may use the 
time horizon (when the principle goes into effect or how long it 
will last) as a way to fractionate the issue. ( ④ ) Another 
approach is to vary the number of ways that the principle may 
be applied. ( ⑤ ) For example, a company may devise a 
family emergency leave plan that allows employees the 
opportunity to be away from the company for a period of no 
longer than three hours, and no more than once a month, for 
illness in the employee’s immediate family. [3점]

There’s a reason for that: traditionally, park designers 
attempted to create such a feeling by planting tall trees at 
park boundaries, building stone walls, and constructing 
other means of partition. 

Parks take the shape demanded by the cultural concerns of 
their time. Once parks are in place, they are no inert stage ―
their purposes and meanings are made and remade by planners 
and by park users. Moments of park creation are particularly 
telling, however, for they reveal and actualize ideas about 
nature and its relationship to urban society. ( ① ) Indeed, what 
distinguishes a park from the broader category of public space 
is the representation of nature that parks are meant to embody.
( ② ) Public spaces include parks, concrete plazas, sidewalks, 
even indoor atriums. ( ③ ) Parks typically have trees, grass, 
and other plants as their central features. ( ④ ) When entering 
a city park, people often imagine a sharp separation from 
streets, cars, and buildings. ( ⑤ ) What’s behind this idea is 
not only landscape architects’ desire to design aesthetically 
suggestive park spaces, but a much longer history of Western 
thought that envisions cities and nature as antithetical spaces 
and oppositional forces.

* aesthetically: 미적으로 ** antithetical: 대조적인

“Craftsmanship” may suggest a way of life that declined 
with the arrival of industrial society ― but this is misleading. 
Craftsmanship names an enduring, basic human impulse, 
the desire to do a job well for its own sake. Craftsmanship 
cuts a far wider swath than skilled manual labor; it serves 
the computer programmer, the doctor, and the artist; 
parenting improves when it is practiced as a skilled craft, 
as does citizenship. In all these domains, craftsmanship 
focuses on objective standards, on the thing in itself. Social 
and economic conditions, however, often stand in the way 
of the craftsman’s discipline and commitment: schools may 
fail to provide the tools to do good work, and workplaces 
may not truly value the aspiration for quality. And though 
craftsmanship can reward an individual with a sense of 
pride in work, this reward is not simple. The craftsman 
often faces conflicting objective standards of excellence; 
the desire to do something well for its own sake can be 
weakened by competitive pressure, by frustration, or by 
obsession.

There is evidence that even very simple algorithms can 
outperform expert judgement on simple prediction problems. 
For example, algorithms have proved more (a) accurate than 
humans in predicting whether a prisoner released on parole 
will go on to commit another crime, or in predicting whether 
a potential candidate will perform well in a job in future. In 
over 100 studies across many different domains, half of all 
cases show simple formulas make (b) better significant 
predictions than human experts, and the remainder (except a 
very small handful), show a tie between the two. When there 
are a lot of different factors involved and a situation is very 
uncertain, simple formulas can win out by focusing on the 
most important factors and being consistent, while human 
judgement is too easily influenced by particularly salient and 
perhaps (c) irrelevant considerations. A similar 
is 
supported by further evidence that ‘checklists’ can improve 
the quality of expert decisions in a range of domains by 
ensuring that important steps or considerations aren’t missed 
when people are feeling (d) relaxed. For example, treating 
patients in intensive care can require hundreds of small 
actions per day, and one small error could cost a life. Using 
checklists to ensure that no crucial steps are missed has 
proved to be remarkably (e) effective in a range of medical 
contexts, from preventing 
to reducing 
pneumonia.

“Dad, these glasses can help correct your red-green color 
blindness,” said Hailey. He slowly put them on, and stared at 
the birthday presents on the table. Seeing vivid red and green 
colors for the first time ever, he started to cry. “Incredible! 
Look at those wonderful colors!” He shouted in amazement. 
Hailey told him in tears, “Dad, I’m glad you can now finally 
enjoy the true beauty of rainbows and roses. Red represents 
love and green represents health. You deserve both ”. Camila

Camila said before (c) her sister handed him a small parcel. 
When he opened it, he discovered a pair of glasses inside. 
“Hailey, Dad doesn’t have eyesight problems,” Camila said, 
puzzled. “Actually Camila, I recently found out he has long 
been suffering from color blindness. He’s kept it a secret so 
as not to worry us,” Hailey explained.

(D)

“I bet (d) you bought a wallet or a watch for him,” Camila 
said. In reply, Hailey answered, “No. I bought something 
much more personal. By the way, there’s something (e) you 
should know about Dad.. ”. They were suddenly interrupted 
by the doorbell ringing. It was their dad and they were 
overjoyed to see him. “My lovely ladies, thank you for 
inviting me to your place for my birthday ”. He walked in 
joyfully, hugging his daughters. They all walked into the 
dining room, where he was greeted with a rainbow-colored 
birthday cake and fifty red roses.

“Hailey, be careful!” Camila yelled uneasily, watching her 
sister carrying a huge cake to the table. “Don’t worry, Camila,” 
Hailey responded, smiling. Camila relaxed only when Hailey
