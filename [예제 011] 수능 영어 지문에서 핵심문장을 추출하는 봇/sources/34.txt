We understand that the segregation of our consciousness
into present, past, and future is both a fiction and an oddly
self-referential framework; your present was part of your
mother’s future, and your children’s past will be in part your
present. Nothing is generally wrong with structuring our
consciousness of time in this conventional manner, and it often
works well enough. In the case of climate change, however,
the sharp division of time into past, present, and future has
been desperately misleading and has, most importantly,
hidden from view the extent of the responsibility of those of
us alive now. The narrowing of our consciousness of time
smooths the way to divorcing ourselves from responsibility
for developments in the past and the future with which our lives
are in fact deeply intertwined. In the climate case, it is not that.
It is that the realities are obscured from view by the partitioning of
time, and so questions of responsibility toward the past and
future do not arise naturally.
