Urban delivery vehicles can be adapted to better suit the
density of urban distribution, which often involves smaller
vehicles such as vans, including bicycles. The latter have the
potential to become a preferred ‘last-mile’ vehicle, particularly
in high-density and congested areas. In locations where
bicycle use is high, such as the Netherlands, delivery bicycles
are also used to carry personal cargo (e.g. groceries). Due to
their low acquisition and maintenance costs, cargo bicycles
convey much potential in developed and developing countries
alike, such as the becak (a three-wheeled bicycle) in Indonesia.
Services using electrically assisted delivery tricycles have
been successfully implemented in France and are gradually
being adopted across Europe for services as varied as parcel
and catering deliveries. Using bicycles as cargo vehicles is
particularly encouraged when combined with policies that
restrict motor vehicle access to specific areas of a city, such as
downtown or commercial districts, or with the extension of
dedicated bike lanes.
