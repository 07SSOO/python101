Everywhere we turn we hear about almighty “cyberspace”!
The hype promises that we will leave our boring lives, put on
goggles and body suits, and enter some metallic, three-dimensional,
multimedia otherworld. When the Industrial Revolution arrived
with its great innovation, the motor, we didn’t leave our world
to go to some remote motorspace! On the contrary, we
brought the motors into our lives, as automobiles, refrigerators,
drill presses, and pencil sharpeners. This absorption has
been so complete that we refer to all these tools with names that
declare their usage, not their “motorness”. These innovations
led to a major socioeconomic movement precisely because they
entered and affected profoundly our everyday lives. People
have not changed fundamentally in thousands of years.
Technology changes constantly. It’s the one that must adapt
to us. That’s exactly what will happen with information technology
and its devices under human-centric computing. The longer we
continue to believe that computers will take us to a magical new
world, the longer we will maintain their natural fusion with
our lives, the hallmark of every major movement that aspires to
be called a socioeconomic revolution.
