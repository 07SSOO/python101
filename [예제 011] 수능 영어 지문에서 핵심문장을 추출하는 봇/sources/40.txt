“Craftsmanship” may suggest a way of life that declined
with the arrival of industrial society ― but this is misleading.
Craftsmanship names an enduring, basic human impulse,
the desire to do a job well for its own sake. Craftsmanship
cuts a far wider swath than skilled manual labor; it serves
the computer programmer, the doctor, and the artist;
parenting improves when it is practiced as a skilled craft,
as does citizenship. In all these domains, craftsmanship
focuses on objective standards, on the thing in itself. Social
and economic conditions, however, often stand in the way
of the craftsman’s discipline and commitment: schools may
fail to provide the tools to do good work, and workplaces
may not truly value the aspiration for quality. And though
craftsmanship can reward an individual with a sense of
pride in work, this reward is not simple. The craftsman
often faces conflicting objective standards of excellence;
the desire to do something well for its own sake can be
weakened by competitive pressure, by frustration, or by
obsession.
