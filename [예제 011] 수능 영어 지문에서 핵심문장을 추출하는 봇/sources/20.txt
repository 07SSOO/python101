At every step in our journey through life we encounter
junctions with many different pathways leading into the
distance. Each choice involves uncertainty about which path will
get you to your destination. Trusting our intuition to make the
choice often ends up with us making a suboptimal choice.
Turning the uncertainty into numbers has proved a potent way of
analyzing the paths and finding the shortcut to your destination.
The mathematical theory of probability hasnâ€™t eliminated risk,
but it allows us to manage that risk more effectively. The strategy
is to analyze all the possible scenarios that the future holds and
then to see what proportion of them lead to success or failure.
This gives you a much better map of the future on which to base
your decisions about which path to choose.
