There’s a reason for that: traditionally, park designers
attempted to create such a feeling by planting tall trees at
park boundaries, building stone walls, and constructing
other means of partition. Parks take the shape demanded by the cultural concerns of
their time. Once parks are in place, they are no inert stage ―
their purposes and meanings are made and remade by planners
and by park users. Moments of park creation are particularly
telling, however, for they reveal and actualize ideas about
nature and its relationship to urban society. Indeed, what
distinguishes a park from the broader category of public space
is the representation of nature that parks are meant to embody.
Public spaces include parks, concrete plazas, sidewalks,
even indoor atriums. Parks typically have trees, grass,
and other plants as their central features. When entering
a city park, people often imagine a sharp separation from
streets, cars, and buildings. What’s behind this idea is
not only landscape architects’ desire to design aesthetically
suggestive park spaces, but a much longer history of Western
thought that envisions cities and nature as antithetical spaces
and oppositional forces.
