Trends constantly suggest new opportunities for individuals
to restage themselves, representing occasions for change. To
understand how trends can ultimately give individuals power
and freedom, one must first discuss fashion’s importance as a
basis for change. The most common explanation offered by
my informants as to why fashion is so appealing is that it
constitutes a kind of theatrical costumery. Clothes are part of
how people present them to the world, and fashion locates
them in the present, relative to what is happening in society
and to fashion’s own history. As a form of expression, fashion
contains a host of ambiguities, enabling individuals to recreate
the meanings associated with specific pieces of clothing.
Fashion is among the simplest and cheapest methods of
self-expression: clothes can be inexpensively purchased
while making it easy to convey notions of wealth, intellectual
stature, relaxation or environmental consciousness, even if
none of these is true. Fashion can also strengthen agency in
various ways, opening up space for action.
