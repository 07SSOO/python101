The most commonly known form of results-based pricing
is a practice called contingency pricing, used by lawyers.
It may be easier to reach an agreement when settlement
terms don’t have to be implemented until months in the future.
(A) Therefore, only an outcome in the client’s favor is
compensated. From the client’s point of view, the pricing
makes sense in part because most clients in these cases are
unfamiliar with and possibly intimidated by law firms.
Their biggest fears are high fees for a case that may take
years to settle.
(B) By using contingency pricing, clients are ensured that they
pay no fees until they receive a settlement. In these and
other instances of contingency pricing, the economic value
of the service is hard to determine before the service, and
providers develop a price that allows them to share the
risks and rewards of delivering value to the buyer.
(C) Contingency pricing is the major way that personal injury
and certain consumer cases are billed. In this approach,
lawyers do not receive fees or payment until the case is
settled, when they are paid a percentage of the money that
the client receives.
