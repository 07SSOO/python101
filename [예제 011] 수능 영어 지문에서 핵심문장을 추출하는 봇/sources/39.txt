Negotiators should try to find ways to slice a large issue into
smaller pieces, known as using salami tactics. Issues
that can be expressed in quantitative, measurable units are easy
to slice. For example, compensation demands can be
divided into cents-per-hour increments or lease rates can be
quoted as dollars per square foot. When working to
fractionate issues of principle or precedent, parties may use the
time horizon (when the principle goes into effect or how long it
will last) as a way to fractionate the issue. Another
approach is to vary the number of ways that the principle may
be applied. For example, a company may devise a
family emergency leave plan that allows employees the
opportunity to be away from the company for a period of no
longer than three hours, and no more than once a month, for
illness in the employeeâ€™s immediate family.
