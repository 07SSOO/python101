“Hailey, be careful!” Camila yelled uneasily, watching her
sister carrying a huge cake to the table. “Don’t worry, Camila,”
Hailey responded, smiling. Camila relaxed only when Hailey
had safely placed the cake on the party table. “Dad will be here
shortly. What gift did you buy for his birthday?” Camila
asked out of interest. “Dad will be surprised to find out what it
is!” Hailey answered with a wink.
“Dad, these glasses can help correct your red-green color
blindness,” said Hailey. He slowly put them on, and stared at
the birthday presents on the table. Seeing vivid red and green
colors for the first time ever, he started to cry. “Incredible!
Look at those wonderful colors!” He shouted in amazement.
Hailey told him in tears, “Dad, I’m glad you can now finally
enjoy the true beauty of rainbows and roses. Red represents
love and green represents health. You deserve both ”. Camila
nodded, seeing how happy her gift of the glasses had
made their dad.
“Happy birthday! You’re fifty today, Dad. We love you!”
Camila said before her sister handed him a small parcel.
When he opened it, he discovered a pair of glasses inside.
“Hailey, Dad doesn’t have eyesight problems,” Camila said,
puzzled. “Actually Camila, I recently found out he has long
been suffering from color blindness. He’s kept it a secret so
as not to worry us,” Hailey explained.
“I bet you bought a wallet or a watch for him,” Camila
said. In reply, Hailey answered, “No. I bought something
much more personal. By the way, there’s something  you
should know about Dad. ”. They were suddenly interrupted
by the doorbell ringing. It was their dad and they were
overjoyed to see him. “My lovely ladies, thank you for
inviting me to your place for my birthday ”. He walked in
joyfully, hugging his daughters. They all walked into the
dining room, where he was greeted with a rainbow-colored
birthday cake and fifty red roses.
