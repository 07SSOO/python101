Actors, singers, politicians and countless others recognise
the power of the human voice as a means of communication
beyond the simple decoding of the words that are used. Learning
to control your voice and use it for different purposes is,
therefore, one of the most important skills to develop as an early
career teacher. The more confidently you give instructions,
the higher the chance of a positive class response. There are
times when being able to project your voice loudly will be very
useful when working in school, and knowing that you can cut
through a noisy classroom, dinner hall or playground is a great
skill to have. In order to address serious noise issues in
school, students, parents and teachers should search for a
solution together. However, I would always advise that you
use your loudest voice incredibly sparingly and avoid shouting
as much as possible. A quiet, authoritative and measured
tone has so much more impact than slightly panicked shouting.
