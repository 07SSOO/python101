Different parts of the brain’s visual system get information
on a need-to-know basis. Cells that help your hand muscles
reach out to an object need to know the size and location of
the object, but they don’t need to know about color. They need
to know a little about shape, but not in great detail. Cells that
help you recognize people’s faces need to be extremely
sensitive to details of shape, but they can pay less attention to
location. It is natural to assume that anyone who sees an object
sees everything about it ― the shape, color, location, and
movement. However, one part of your brain sees its shape,
another sees color, another detects location, and another
perceives movement. Consequently, after localized brain
damage, it is possible to see certain aspects of an object and
not others. Centuries ago, people found it difficult to imagine
how someone could see an object without seeing what color it
is. Even today, you might find it surprising to learn about
people who see an object without seeing where it is, or see it
without seeing whether it is moving.
