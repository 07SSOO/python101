The entrance to a honeybee colony, often referred to as
the dancefloor, is a market place for information about the
state of the colony and the environment outside the hive.
Studying interactions on the dancefloor provides us with a
number of individuals illustrative examples of how
changing their own behavior in response to local information. For
example, upon returning to their hive honeybees that have
collected water search out a receiver bee to unload their water
to within the hive. If this search time is short then the returning
bee is more likely to perform a waggle dance to recruit others
to the water source. Conversely, if this search time is long then
the bee is more likely to give up collecting water. Since
receiver bees will only accept water if they require it, either for
themselves or to pass on to other bees and brood, this unloading
time is correlated with the colony’s overall need of water. Thus
the individual water forager’s response to unloading time (up or
down) regulates water collection in response to the colony’s
need.
