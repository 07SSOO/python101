To whom it may concern,

My name is Michael Brown. I have been a bird-watcher since
childhood. I have always enjoyed watching birds in my yard
and identifying them by sight and sound. Yesterday, I happened
to read an article about your club. I was surprised and excited
to find out about a community of passionate bird-watchers who
travel annually to go birding. I would love to join your club,
but your website appears to be under construction. I could not
find any information except for this contact email address. I
would like to know how to sign up for the club. I look forward
to your reply.

Sincerely,
Michael Brown
