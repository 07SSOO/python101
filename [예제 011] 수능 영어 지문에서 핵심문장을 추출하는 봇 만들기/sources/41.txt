There is evidence that even very simple algorithms can
outperform expert judgement on simple prediction problems.
For example, algorithms have proved more accurate than
humans in predicting whether a prisoner released on parole
will go on to commit another crime, or in predicting whether
a potential candidate will perform well in a job in future. In
over 100 studies across many different domains, half of all
cases show simple formulas make better significant
predictions than human experts, and the remainder (except a
very small handful), show a tie between the two. When there
are a lot of different factors involved and a situation is very
uncertain, simple formulas can win out by focusing on the
most important factors and being consistent, while human
judgement is too easily influenced by particularly salient and
perhaps irrelevant considerations. A similar is
supported by further evidence that ‘checklists’ can improve
the quality of expert decisions in a range of domains by
ensuring that important steps or considerations aren’t missed
when people are feeling relaxed. For example, treating
patients in intensive care can require hundreds of small
actions per day, and one small error could cost a life. Using
checklists to ensure that no crucial steps are missed has
proved to be remarkably effective in a range of medical
contexts, from preventing to reducing pneumonia.
