A fascinating species of water flea exhibits a kind of
flexibility that evolutionary biologists call adaptive plasticity.

(A) That’s a clever trick, because producing spines and a
helmet is costly, in terms of energy, and conserving
energy is essential for an organism’s ability to survive and
reproduce. The water flea only expends the energy needed
to produce spines and a helmet when it needs to.

(B) If the baby water flea is developing into an adult in water
that includes the chemical signatures of creatures that
prey on water fleas, it develops a helmet and spines to
defend itself against predators. If the water around it
doesn’t include the chemical signatures of predators, the
water flea doesn’t develop these protective devices.

(C) So it may well be that this plasticity is an adaptation: a
trait that came to exist in a species because it contributed
to reproductive fitness. There are many cases, across
many species, of adaptive plasticity. Plasticity is conducive
to fitness if there is sufficient variation in the environment.
