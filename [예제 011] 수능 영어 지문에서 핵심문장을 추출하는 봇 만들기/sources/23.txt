An important advantage of disclosure, as opposed to more
aggressive forms of regulation, is its flexibility and respect for
the operation of free markets. Regulatory mandates are blunt
swords; they tend to neglect diversity and may have serious
unintended adverse effects. For example, energy efficiency
requirements for appliances may produce goods that work less
well or that have characteristics that consumers do not want.
Information provision, by contrast, respects freedom of
choice. If automobile manufacturers are required to measure
and publicize the safety characteristics of cars, potential car
purchasers can trade safety concerns against other attributes,
such as price and styling. If restaurant customers are informed
of the calories in their meals, those who want to lose weight
can make use of the information, leaving those who are
unconcerned about calories unaffected. Disclosure does not
interfere with, and should even promote, the autonomy (and
quality) of individual decision-making.
